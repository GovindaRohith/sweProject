Generate an Application-Specific Password:

    Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
    In the left-hand menu, select "Security".
    Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords".
    Sign in if prompted, and then select "Mail" from the "Select app" dropdown and "Other (Custom name)" from the "Select device" dropdown.
    Enter a name for the app (e.g., "nodemailer") and click "Generate".
    Google will generate a 16-digit passcode. Copy this passcode as you'll need it for nodemailer.
